/*  ok,so. do the grid-template-areas thing where you can make the boxes out of words. 
make boxes with grid-area: thingy and then "thingy" will be the box you want
then do something like 

title title
me  jump_menu
me  jump_menu
business  words1
CYOA  words2
Garden  words3

and it'll work like magic and you'll have boxes. and you can space the margins
in percentages so that it shrinks and grows better. yippee!
